          <h1>Lisense</h1>
          <p>Licenses sometimes have little sense. Too often they're difficult to read, incredibly long and full of legal traps. How can this take place in a world so focused on user experience? </p>

          <p>Lisense is a simple web app that aims to improve the world of licenses.</p>
